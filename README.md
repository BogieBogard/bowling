# bowling

Thank you for your time and consideration for my application to WeInfuse's Full-Stack Software Developer position!

This is my repo solution for the bowling coding problem. The `bowlingCalculator.js` file contains my solution for the coding exercise.

I included unit tests for my solution. To run the unit tests you can run `npm install` and then `npx jest`.

I also created a simple and fun html page that interacts with my solution. You can  test the score calculation logic by entering in values into the text field. The webpage is available at https://mbogard.com/bowling ; you can also spin this repo up locally and look at the `index.html` file to test the calculation logic locally as well.

Please note, the bowling pin graphic on the webpage is not my own. I did a quick web search to find a graphic. The bowling pin graphic and its CSS powered jiggling animation is open source code that I included to make the page more visually appealing. The JavaScript calculation logic is entirely my own.

Thank you!
